# word-trainer

While typing, I consistently make the same errors over and over. There are some words that I always get wrong.
So I created this small app to train those words and develop muscle memory.

## Usage
Just clone, `npm install` and start with `npm start`
The app will ask you to type the word you want to train. Then it will ask you the number of times you want to repeat it.
After that you can start practicing typing the word.
When you finish it will tell you how many times you got it right.
